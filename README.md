## CSS

- The font for Get Weather button should be same size as Zip Code input

- The card `<div>` should be colored with hex #f1f1f1

- Header `<div>` should be visible

## Flexbox

- CSS has incorrect Flex property. Wrapper `<div>` should grow; Keeping the header and footer `<div>` docked to top and bottom of the page.

   Reference: <https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/flex/>

- Items in Content `<div>` should be centered using flex.

   Reference: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container>

## HTML

- Browser Tab needs to display the text Weather App, not the URL.

- Font Awesome is not connected. Cloud and Copyright Icons should be made visible. 

   *HINT: Fix "Header should be visible" issue first*

   Reference: <https://www.w3schools.com/icons/fontawesome5_intro.asp>

- Missing attribute. On page load the country list should populate.

## JavaScript

- United States should be default country in settings 

   *HINT: Fix "country list should populate" issue first*

## Bonus (optional)

- Stop `<form>` from getting weather if zip code `<input>` has no value and alert user to enter a zip code.
